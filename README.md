this project consist in an interactive website which give you easier comprehension of the differents submissions's stats on the Inginious platform
</p>

<p> The first parts of this project (directory TP1) is a simple read of the .csv data files from WHO organisation in a graph from Chart.js integrated with Python Flask module and string replacer</p>

<p> An important things to understand is (except for the page 'jerome.html') that .html files located in the TP1 directory run only with flask, because we use it to fill the graph with a string replacer then the .html files have upper keywords which don't match witch Js script in the page.</p>
